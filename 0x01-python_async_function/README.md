# 0x01. Python - Async

## Description
This project involves learning and implementing asynchronous programming in Python. You will explore the `async` and `await` syntax, execute async programs using `asyncio`, run concurrent coroutines, create asyncio tasks, and utilize the `random` module.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and use `async` and `await` syntax.
- Execute an async program with `asyncio`.
- Run concurrent coroutines.
- Create asyncio tasks.
- Use the `random` module for generating random numbers.

## Requirements
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7.
- All your files should end with a new line.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- Documentation should be comprehensive, explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method in a real sentence.
